# Getting Started

## Installation

To install Chroma, you must first have access to the `@lifeomic` private npm
repository. To receive access, follow the instructions in the
[developer onboarding wiki](https://bitbucket.org/lifeomic/wiki/src/master/developer-onboarding.md).

Once access is granted, add Chroma to your React application by running:

```bash
yarn add @lifeomic/chroma-react
```

## Installing Peer Dependencies

### Material UI

Chroma has a peer dependency on Material-UI, so you'll also need to run:

```bash
# Browse to https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/ to learn more

yarn add @material-ui/core
yarn add @material-ui/styles
```

### React Router Dom

Chroma has a peer dependency on React Router, so you'll need to add that as
well:

```bash
# Browse to https://reacttraining.com/react-router/ to learn more

yarn add react-router-dom
```

### Framer Motion

Although not required, we ♥️ framer-motion, so we recommend adding it too:

```bash
yarn add framer-motion
```

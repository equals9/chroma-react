# Getting Started

<span style="color: #637585; font-size: 1.25rem">Chroma is a Design System to
build LifeOmic products.</span>

## Overview

Chroma is a component library that is design-approved. The goal of Chroma is to
help developers and designers build accessible React apps with speed.

## Accessibility

Chroma aims to be as web accessible as possible. Our goal is to strictly follow
WAI-ARIA standards as much as we can. All components should come with the proper
attributes and keyboard interactions out of the box. To read more about web
accessibility, check out
[the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).
Each component has an accessibility section documenting how and why it is
accessible.
